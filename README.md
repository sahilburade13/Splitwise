# Splitwise
Designed and implemented a Splitwise-like expense settlement system that efficiently minimizes the number of financial transactions required to settle shared expenses among multiple users. The system computes each user’s net balance from a list of expense transactions and applies a greedy Minimum Cash Flow algorithm to optimize settlements.
